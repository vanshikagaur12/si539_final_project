        <h2>Client Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          United We Care (UWC) is a mental health startup specializing in
          providing a comprehensive range of resources to support its users'
          mental well-being. These resources include booking and attending
          online sessions with professional therapists through the app, an
          AI-powered virtual wellness coach chatbot and more.
        </p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          The beta version of UWC was built entirely by developers to test all
          the features. However, it did not prioritize the user experience. User
          testing revealed poor task success rate, with only 40% of users able
          to complete primary tasks like booking an appointment or finding
          relevant articles. This highlighted the need for a revamp before
          moving to Release 1.
        </p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          I redesigned United We Care's key user flows with a focus on reducing,
          for example, appointment booking time, and other turnaround times with
          customers. I ensured consistency by keeping a cohesive layout that
          aligns with UWC's branding and added alternate pathways for completing
          tasks.
