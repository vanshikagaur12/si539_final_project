            Revitalized a tech solutions firm’s website, boosting direct traffic
            by over 20% and decreasing primary user flow bounce rate by 30%.

        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          WorldLink, a tech solutions staffing firm, has experienced substantial
          growth in the past decade, however its website has not and remains
          unchanged from its last update in 2008. Its poor metrics and outdated
          branding underscore the pressing need for a revitalized online
          presence.
        </p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          By looking at Google Analytics from the past 5 years, with an emphasis
          on the last 2 years, we learned that the current website had a very
          low percentage of return users (7.8%) and a high bounce rate (41.26%).
          In addition, the average session duration was less than a minute,
          leading to poor conversions.
        </p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          We designed a brand new website from scratch laying emphasis on strong
          branding, clean UI, intuitive user flow, and authentic visuals
          consisting of WL employees. We also created a systems library to help
          with future rebrands and edits!
