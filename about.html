              Hi, my name is Vanshika and I'm currently based in Ann Arbor, MI.
              I am pursuing a masters degree in Information Science with a UX
              and HCI specialization from the University of Michigan. I was
              previously Product Designer at WorldLink in Frisco, TX. I am
              passionate about creating accessible and inclusive experiences,
              that not only meet user needs but also predicts them.

              I graduated from the University of California, Irvine with a
              degree in Psychological Science which has been a significant
              source of inspiration for my work as it aids my understanding of
              human behavior. I am excited to bring my academic and practical
              experiences to my work as a Product designer.

              When I'm not working, I love spending time with my dog, taking
              long walks, trying out new recipes, and exploring coffee shops!
